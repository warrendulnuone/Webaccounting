To read a value from arguments: e.arguments.find(\"argumentName\").data\n'TIP: You can also set the value of an argument. For example: e.arguments[e.arguments.ArgumentNumber(\"country\")].data = \"portugal\"\n\n'You can set the initial value of any field by setting the property (see comment at end for Javascript technique to use when setting values for a large number of controls)\n'e.control.<fieldname>\n'For example:\n'e.control.firstname = \"Fred\"\n'e.control.lastname = \"Jones\"\n\n'For multi-valued controls (such as checkbox, List control configured as multi-select, etc.) you can set the value to a cr-lf list of values or use the special array() syntax.\n'Either of the following two methods will work\n'e.control.colors = \"array(red,green)\"\n'e.control.colors = comma_to_crlf(\"red,green\")\n\n'To set the value of a field in a repeating section, you must use \"_A5INSTANCE\" and the instance number as a suffix on the fieldname.\n'For example:\n'e.control.firstname_A5INSTANCE2 = \"Bob\"  'sets the value in the 2nd row of the repeating section.\n\n'To specify any javascript that you want to execute set the  e.javascript property.

It is ONLY needed if the ._setRepeatingSectionRowCount() method has been called.\n'//The command copies default values into the _d object. Without this command, default values defined in the component will not be set.\n'//$u.o.assign(_d,DLG1_DlgObj.originalValues[0]);\n\n'_d['B'] = 'alpha'; //set the value of a control called 'B'\n'_d['E:2'] = 'beta'; //set the value of a control called 'E' in the 2nd Repeating Section row\n'_d['G:6'] = ['Red','Green']; //set the value of a checkbox called 'G' in the 6th Repeating Section row to 'Red' and 'Green'\n'{dialog.object}.prepare();\n'{dialog.object}.populate(_d);\n'{dialog.object}.refreshClientSideComputations();\n\n'%txt%\n\n'Now, emit the Javascript...\n'e.javascript = js\n\n'NOTE: In the above example, if the ._setRepeating() method is called in the 'onDialogInitialize' event, you are responsible for setting\n'values in ALL of the controls in the component. For example, if you have defined default values for some controls, and then set the values\n'of other controls using the .populate() method, only the values set in the _d object will be set. (The default values will NOT be set).\n'You can, however, put the default values into the _d object using this code:\n'$u.o.assign(_d,{dialog.object}.originalValues[0]);\n\n\n\n\n'Tip: You can use the xbasic varToJSON() function to help generate the Javascript object passed to the .populate() method.\n'For example:\n'dim j as p\n'j.firstname = \"John\"\n'j.lastname = \"Smith\"\n'j.quantity_a5instance1 = \"2\"\n'dim j.colorchoices_a5instance2[3] as c\n'j.colorchoices_a5instance2[1] = \"Red\"\n'j.colorchoices_a5instance2[2] = \"Blue\"\n'dim jsTxt as c\n'jsTxt = varToJSON(j)\n'js = \"{dialog.object}.populate(\" + jsTxt + \"); {dialog.object}.prepare();\"\n\n\n'TIP: To simulate session variables when running in Working Preview you can use this code:\n'if eval_valid(\"request.SERVER_PROTOCOL\") then \n'\tif request.SERVER_PROTOCOL = \"A5RES\" then \n'\t\t'running in working preview\n'\t\tsession.var1 = \"simulated value for var1\"\n'\tend if \n'end if \n\nend function\n",
